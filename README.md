# Air-Plane-Simulator
This project has been coded in JAVA using abstract data structures. 
It prints the events happening in every minute of simulation. 
The values are taken randomly using the probability and are greatly taken care of to make sure that the details are getting updated every minute. 
There are different cases when the simulation has to consider special cases. 
Whenever there is an Air Force Plane, all the other activities like boarding and departure pauses until the Air Force plane departures.
Once the Air Force plane departures, all the other activities continue to resume. 
Also, whenever there is a passenger with positive covid test, all the departures get delayed by specific time. 
The simulation runs for the minutes decided by the user. This simulation takes every case into consideration and prints the correct output under correct events.
